A selection of my works can be found on frontend mentor and github.</p>
                        <p>You can usually find me engaged in a variety of activities when I'm not in front of my computer. Along with singing, reading, playing badminton, watching k-dramas, and discovering amazing random facts, I also like to listen to music.
